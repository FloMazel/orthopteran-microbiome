This code is used in the paper entitled "Contrasted host specificity of gut and endosymbiont bacterial communities
 in alpine grasshoppers and crickets". 
 
 It takes 16S amplicon sequences and metadata as input and provide an analysis of hosty specificity and phylosymbiosis across endosymbionts and putative gut symbionts ;
